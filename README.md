**Freya** is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for compressing files. Built with Rust and the power of **zstd**, it combines high compression ratios with a responsive, beautiful interface that never freezes.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Blazing Fast:** Powered by the industry-standard `zstd` algorithm for a perfect balance of speed and compression ratio.
- **🖥️ Modern TUI:** A clean, keyboard-driven interface built with [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui).
- **🧵 Never Freezes:** Compression runs on a background thread, keeping the UI snappy and providing real-time progress updates.
- **📂 Native File Picker:** Integrates with your OS's native file dialog for easy file selection.
- **🦀 Pure Rust:** Built for performance, safety, and reliability.
